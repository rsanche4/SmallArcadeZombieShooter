## Installation ##
Because this game uses Java, you need to download the JRE so it can run. Download here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OIZFhHjqgQhI2Bw9E2dTQgvT26SmUsWT/view?usp=drive_link

After you download it from the link above, simply unzip and drag the JRE folder into this directory. That's it!

Or, if you want to just download the full .zip of the game and extract and just be ready to go in one go, download it here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y0uyJb2nrHxRRC-xo6TaupbxWap6aEib/view?usp=drive_link

You should be on Windows for this to run!
Either way, once ready, double click run.vbs to start playing! Good luck!
